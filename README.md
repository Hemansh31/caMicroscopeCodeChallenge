The two OpenSeaDragon instances are synced on checking the sync checkbox and zooming or panning in any one produces a simultaneous result in the other one.

Now you can configure the two OpenSeadragon instances for examples (set center, set rotation ) and then sync them

Steps to configure:
Select the configure option which enable you to move the pointer to any other point by clicking. Note, when configure option is selected the image can only be zoomed in using the scroll on mouse.
Also one can independently rotate the images in configure mode and then syncing the images would sync them according the constraints you configured.
